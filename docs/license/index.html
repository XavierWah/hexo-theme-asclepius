<h3 id="Statement-of-Purpose"><a href="#Statement-of-Purpose" class="headerlink" title="Statement of Purpose"></a>Statement of Purpose</h3><p>The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer<br>exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator<br>and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an “owner”) of an original work of<br>authorship and&#x2F;or a database (each, a “Work”).</p>
<p>Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for<br>the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and<br>scientific works (“Commons”) that the public can reliably and without fear<br>of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other<br>works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever<br>and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.<br>These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free<br>culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific<br>works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in<br>part through the use and efforts of others.</p>
<p>For these and&#x2F;or other purposes and motivations, and without any<br>expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person<br>associating CC0 with a Work (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she<br>is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily<br>elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its<br>terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the<br>Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.</p>
<ol>
<li>Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be<br>protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and<br>Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not<br>limited to, the following:</li>
</ol>
<p>  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,<br>     communicate, and translate a Work;<br> ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and&#x2F;or performer(s);<br>iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or<br>     likeness depicted in a Work;<br> iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,<br>     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;<br>  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data<br>     in a Work;<br> vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96&#x2F;9&#x2F;EC of the<br>     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal<br>     protection of databases, and under any national implementation<br>     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such<br>     directive); and<br>vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the<br>     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national<br>     implementations thereof.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention<br>of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,<br>irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of<br>Affirmer’s Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes<br>of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as<br>future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories<br>worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or<br>treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future<br>medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,<br>including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional<br>purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each<br>member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and<br>successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to<br>revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or<br>equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public<br>as contemplated by Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason<br>be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the<br>Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into<br>account Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the<br>extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected<br>person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,<br>irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and<br>Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the<br>maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future<br>time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number<br>of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without<br>limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the<br>“License”). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was<br>applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any<br>reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such<br>partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder<br>of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she<br>will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related<br>Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of<br>action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer’s<br>express Statement of Purpose.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Limitations and Disclaimers.</p>
