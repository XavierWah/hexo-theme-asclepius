**Asclepius** is a concise hexo theme developed from [hexo-theme-apollo](https://github.com/pinggod/hexo-theme-apollo). 

## Documents

For installation instructions, optional configurations, advanced customization guides and more, please read our [*document*](docs/document.md). 

## Development

*Retaining the essence of simplicity*. That's the only guiding ideology of this *concise* theme, which enables users to start using asclepius only after *basic* configurations. 

Currently, we are slowly refactoring the previous project, and adding new features and support of integrations of other projects. For example, code highlighting, comments, and more. 

## Contributing

We are still on the way to realize our guiding ideology. As the result, you may *fork* this repository and modify it to your liking. It's as well an encouragement for us. 

If the changes you make are universal to this project, you can *pull request* to this project to be a contributor. However, your *commits* should follow our *commit specifications*.
